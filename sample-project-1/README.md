## React + Redux real world example.
 You can view a live demo over at https://mehranjamali.github.io \
 I left the front `Redux DevTools` open so that you can check the site better.
- You can see the code on my GitHub: [source code](https://github.com/mehranjamali/mehranjamali.github.io-source_code/tree/master/sample-project-1) 

 
 In this project I have developed some features of Linkedin and other similar Websites.\
 The purpose of doing this project is to challenge myself and create a portfolio.\
 I would be grateful if you send me your comments and criticisms.

## Functionality overview
The example application does not use any server, everything is local but I implemented authentication and asynchronous operation logic in my services and middlewares, I have used `Redux-Thunk` for this purpose.

General functionality: 
- Authenticate users. ( login page:  Sign in with any `username` and `password` you want + Sign in with `google` + logout button )
- Create post ( with photo )
- Like 
- Follow other users
- Save your Favorite post
- Report post 
- Hide post
- Notification in navbar
- CRUD Author and Book (Table)

The general page breakdown looks like this: (Protected = need login)
- Home page (URL: /#/ )
  - create post button ( with photo ) - Protected 
  - List of posts 
    - like - Protected 
    - report - Protected 
    - hide - Protected
